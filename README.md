This is my second try in making a particle simualtion using the python graphics **libary pygame**.

No external libraries, just pure math and coding. All the physics functions are somewhat accurate of real life.

Features:

- 3 Environment types (1,2,3): box, loop, endless
- 3 collision types (7,8,9): bounce, merge, none
- env gravity control (direction arrow keys)
- mouse (hold left) as anchor for pushin/pulling (p) single/all (a) particles
- ability to spawn new particles (s) with varying radius (i/k)
